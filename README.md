# Predicting Twitter Interactions in a Polarized Environment

## Overview

Link prediction algorithms are used to attempt to determine where new edges will form on graphs, and they boast a variety of applications spanning from social to biological networks. In this project, we adapt an existing link prediction model and apply it to a graph of tweets, with the goal being predicting interactions between Twitter users.

We analyze five separate fake news stories which were spread on Twitter, using information about the tweets and the users that posted them to forecast which users will interact in a notoriously divisive environment. Our results show that the method yields a good prediction performance, being capable of correctly identifying the vast majority of interactions within very few guesses.
